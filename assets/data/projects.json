      "description": "Developed a researcher discovery tool that helps students find professors for research opportunities. The application searches for researchers by author name, extracts and summarizes keywords using KeyBERT, and generates comprehensive researcher profiles including affiliation information using DeepSeek R1 LLM. This tool bridges the gap between students and potential research mentors by providing detailed insights into professors' expertise and research areas.",
